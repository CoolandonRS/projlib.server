# projlib.server
A utility library for projects of mine. Its current primary (and only) purpose is updating.

Check out [the client side code](https://github.com/CoolandonRS/projlib.client), too.

Both will be pushed onto nuget once they become more feature-complete and after a small amount of testing.
